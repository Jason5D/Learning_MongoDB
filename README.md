# Learning_MongoDB

This repo is to help me learn the basics of MongoDB.

Having created an account with MongoDB and following through with a tutorial this should give me the first steps before I create an application using it.

I want to be able to:

- Execute commands in the mongo shell, an interactive command line interface to MongoDB that uses JavaScript syntax.

- Perform basic database operations, such as create new records, and read, update, and delete existing ones.

- Create and use indexes in MongoDB to improve the efficiency of your queries.

- Articulate the fundamental concepts behind data modeling and how to build relationships between MongoDB data.

- Explain the concept of aggregation and the basic components of an aggregation pipeline.
Deploy your own MongoDB Atlas cluster.
